# Final-Project

Our game is called “brick breaker”, which basically is a ball game. The game is divided into three levels with increasing difficulty. At the start of every level, we have 32 bricks at the top of the interface, a ball and a paddle at the bottom. When we firstly bounce the ball to hit the bricks, it means that the game starts. When the ball touches the bricks, the bricks will be eliminated from the interface and the player would get 5 points. Our target is to eliminate all the bricks. If the ball touches the bricks or the edge of the interface, it should be rebounded to the reciprocal direction. At the bottom of the interface, we have a movable paddle that can be controlled by mouth to re-bounce the returning ball. When 32 bricks are all eliminated, we will enter the next level, the speed of bouncing ball will increase, so the player should response it faster. If the paddle does not successfully hold the returning bouncing ball, the player would lose one turn but continue the game by pressing the keyboard “R”. After all levels passed, the player wins the game. The fewer turns the players need, the better they perform in this game.
